# kidum-next-time
A simple program which saves your tasks and words so you can use them to practise for the next test.

Note: this program only saves the tasks and words for people who ALREADY paid for the website. 
Because the tasks and words are different for each person, it does not promote any "free course" actions.

If you want to sue me, please, before doing so, send me an email to lukacat100@gmail.com. 
I will shutdown the library within 24 hours maximum, guarenteed!
